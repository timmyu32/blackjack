# blackjack
A game of blackjack in Python 3, altough not the convential rules.
I changed the way the computer plays from a crazy nest of if else statements to a singular concise while loop.
I did not think this was possible when I made the game but I have now realized it is so I changed it up.
Also made it so there is a 20% chance the dealer will choose to recieve another card when his hand is already > 16.
Also added an autoplay feature that tracks your wins.
